     Popview is a UIViewController base, therefore it already has a filled view in. This method allows
     implementation to layout it customly. For example:
     
     ```
     view.cornerRadius = 7
     view.autoCenterInSuperview()
     ```

     Show animation
     
     The presenter page has overlayView, use this if we want to animation the overlayView too, e.g alpha
     */
    func show(overlayView: UIView)
    
    /*
     Hide animation
     
     Must call completion when the animation is finished
     */
